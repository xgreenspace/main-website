        <p>I was born in Santa Monica, California on May 3, 2001 to my mother, Dedra Aikins, and my father, Cedric West. I lived in Los Angeles County from my birth until the age of of 7 when I moved to Houston, Texas. I jumped around alot in elementry school, but I by the time I entered middle school, I stayed put. I attended Roberson Middle School, a magnet school that specialized in science and technology within my district. There, by my 8th grade year, I had earned several awards by competing in Science Olympiad, and I had the overall highest grade point average for the year. For high school, I attented Westfield high school where I participated in a variety of extracurriculars. I joined track and field, performed several activities in my school's debate organization, did various volunteer work, and participated in many other activities around campus. Later, I graduated Westfield as salutatorian in 2019. Currently, I attend Texas A&M University in College Station where I am working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. I have joined a couple of organizations including NSBE and IEEE, and I am apart of the Engineering Honors Program.</p>
