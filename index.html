        <p>Howdy! I am a college student in Texas A&M's Engineering Honors program, and I am currently working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. I have a great passion for developing new skills relating to programming and technology. Currently, I have experiance writing in Python, Javascript, HTML, and Java, and I have a knack for easily picking up new languages. I am eager to gain further experiance working as an intern where I'll be able to contribute myself to projects.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Biography</h3>
        <p>One thing I pride myself on is my ability to adapt and take on challenging tasks. When I first entered university, I had to quickly adjust my habits in order to excel academically. I refined my abiltity to absorb information and immediately apply to the task at hand. </p>
